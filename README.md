# Samson Project

![Samson Project](./images/samsonLogo.PNG)

The Samson aims to automate and optimize water usage through soil moisture sensors, weather data integration, and an efficient irrigation system to improve apple yield and conserve resources. This system will reduce water waste, enhance crop quality, and support sustainable farming practices.

Here's why:
* about 1/3 of all stretchers are lost every year and this could be optimized causing a great impact on society
* Saving time by using the latest technology can greatly increase productivity and make life easier for farmers
* Optimizing losses and time, the possibility of increasing the quantity of product and quality, could make food cheaper to a certain extent


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

As the project is large and we wouldn't be able to handle everything due to time constraints, our priorities and objectives were located in the area of temperature measurement in the fields.

### Prerequisites

In order to be able to implement ourselves and better understand how we could achieve our goal and get a more precise answer, we would first need to gather knowledge of how microcontrollers and the current technologies used work.

To do this, we set ourselves some learning objectives for the project and for our group. These are:

1. Learn how a microcontroller works using an arduino (the microcontroller available)
2. learn how to run a server on a raspberry if necessary (which wasn't the case)
3. understand the current project and the requirements as a whole
4. Being able to analyze and prioritize the entire project using design thinking methods


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Problem definition
- [x] Use structured methods to visualize possible problems and solutions
- [x] Learning to use microcontrollers and microcomputers
- [x] Find hardware that is effective and within the given parameters
- [x] Creating an architectural design
- [x] Making a prototype


## defining the problem and idealizing the solution

We were given the objective of being able to think about the problem with at least 2 different techniques and that's what we did.

1. First we start with a simple way of solving and thinking about the problem. We use the 5w method because it's simple and shows a lot about where our problem is headed.

2. As a second option, we like to find out what the causes of the current problems are and differentiate between what the problems really are and visualize the situation as a whole. At this point we like to choose the problem tree to define this

3. In order to think of the most feasible solution, we like to follow the Disney method, because we are able to think together and discuss ideas in a structured way, showing various ways in which the project can be developed and adapted according to different ideas.
