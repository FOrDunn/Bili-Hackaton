# Samson Project

![Samson Project](./images/samsonLogo.PNG)

The Samson aims to automate and optimize water usage through soil moisture sensors, weather data integration, and an efficient irrigation system to improve apple yield and conserve resources. This system will reduce water waste, enhance crop quality, and support sustainable farming practices.

Here's why:
* about 1/3 of all stretchers are lost every year and this could be optimized causing a great impact on society
* Saving time by using the latest technology can greatly increase productivity and make life easier for farmers
* Optimizing losses and time, the possibility of increasing the quantity of product and quality, could make food cheaper to a certain extent


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

As the project is large and we wouldn't be able to handle everything due to time constraints, our priorities and objectives were located in the area of temperature measurement in the fields.

### Prerequisites

In order to be able to implement ourselves and better understand how we could achieve our goal and get a more precise answer, we would first need to gather knowledge of how microcontrollers and the current technologies used work.

To do this, we set ourselves some learning objectives for the project and for our group. These are:

1. Learn how a microcontroller works using an arduino (the microcontroller available)
2. learn how to run a server on a raspberry if necessary (which wasn't the case)
3. understand the current project and the requirements as a whole
4. Being able to analyze and prioritize the entire project using design thinking methods
